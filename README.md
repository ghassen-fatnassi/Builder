# Automated Model Training, Testing, and Prediction Project 🚀🤖

## Overview

This project aims to automate the process of model development, testing, and prediction through a structured folder system. By organizing your project into three main directories - `data`, `scripts`, and `models`, you can streamline your workflow and enhance collaboration.

## Folder Structure 📂


📁 Modular

|__ 📁 data       # Directory for storing data

|__ 📁 scripts    # Directory for storing scripts

|__ 📁 models     # Directory for storing trained models

|__ 📄 README.md  # Project overview and instructions


## Usage Instructions ℹ️

### Data Management

Store raw data files in the `data` directory. Use scripts in the `scripts` directory for data preprocessing, feature engineering, etc.

### Model Development

Utilize scripts in the `scripts` directory to develop and train machine learning models. Save trained models in the `models` directory.

### Model Testing and Evaluation

Use scripts in the `scripts` directory to evaluate model performance, conduct testing, and validate results.

## Usage in CNN Competitions 🏆

This modular structure has been instrumental in my participation in CNN competitions. By organizing my data, scripts, and models in a systematic manner, I've been able to efficiently iterate on model development, test different architectures, and fine-tune hyperparameters. This structure has not only improved my productivity but also facilitated collaboration with teammates.

## Future Plans

I plan to continue improving this modular structure, especially after mastering PyTorch. With PyTorch's flexibility and powerful capabilities for deep learning, I aim to integrate advanced model architectures and techniques into my workflow. By leveraging PyTorch's ecosystem, I intend to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of my model development process even further.

## 🎉 Happy Modeling! 🎉

With this organized structure, you're all set to embark on your model development journey. Feel free to customize and expand upon this framework to suit your specific project needs. Happy coding! 😊
