# Automated Model Training, Testing, and Prediction Project 🚀🤖

## Overview

This project aims to automate the process of model development, testing, and prediction through a structured folder system. By organizing your project into three main directories - `data`, `scripts`, and `models`, you can streamline your workflow and enhance collaboration.

## Folder Structure 📂


📁 Modular

|__ 📁 data       # Directory for storing data

|__ 📁 scripts    # Directory for storing scripts

|__ 📁 models     # Directory for storing trained models

|__ 📄 README.md  # Project overview and instructions


## Usage Instructions ℹ️

### Data Management

Store raw data files in the `data` directory. Use scripts in the `scripts` directory for data preprocessing, feature engineering, etc.

### Model Development

Utilize scripts in the `scripts` directory to develop and train machine learning models. Save trained models in the `models` directory.

### Model Testing and Evaluation

Use scripts in the `scripts` directory to evaluate model performance, conduct testing, and validate results.

## 🎉 Happy Modeling! 🎉

With this organized structure, you're all set to embark on your model development journey. Feel free to customize and expand upon this framework to suit your specific project needs. Happy coding! 😊
